# iroha

A template based colour palette generator. Using Google's Material Colour Utilities under the hood.

## How to build
1. Create a directory called `build`
2. Change to that directory, and then `cmake ../`
3. Then execute `make`
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ && make
```

### !! This code is basically still a boilerplate. Don't expect this to be working out of the box. And the documentation is at the minimal. !!

## Contribute
I have no code of conduct obviously. And I'm expecting that this codebase will not be that big. But if you could prove me wrong, I'll definitely going to tidy this repo up.
